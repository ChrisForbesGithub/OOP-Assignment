 OOP Knowledge Assignment

Imagine you are working at a game studio, and they want you to help with installing Git. 

1.	Write instructions on installing git on a windows system. Making sure to include
a.	What are the requirements to install Git on a system.
b.	If you had issues installing Git the workplace, give instructions on who you could you enquire about the installation disruption.

Since git already comes pre-installed by default on some computers, it would first be useful to check if it is already present in the system in question. Open the Windows Command
Prompt or Git Bash and type in "git version". The terminal application's output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or will tell you that "git" is an unknown
command, which means it still needs to be installed.
Git is available to download on gitforwindows, a Git website. Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version. Once the installer has started, follow
the instructions provided by the Git Setup Wizard until the installation has finished. To verify that Git has been installed, open whichever terminal application you selected to use
during the Git installation (either Git Bash of the Windows Command Prompt) and type in "git version".
If any issues are encountered during the installation of Git in the workplace, it would be advisable to contact the workplace's technical support personnel.

2.	Do research on some principles/techniques of industry standard best practices creating and working with repositories and branches in Git. 
a.	List the most important principles/techniques for creating and working with repositories
b.	List the most important principles/techniques for creating and working with branches

The most important principles/techniques for creating and working with repositories are to create a README file for every repository, to keep the README file updated with important
information and guidelines about the project, and to favour branching over forking when possible. The most important principles/techniques for creating and working with branches are
that branches and commits to branches should be named in a consistent manner and that a consistent branch strategy should be adopted to prevent arbitrary branching.

3.	List the steps in a Git workflow that the team should follow when working on projects.

First, all the required software for the projects (such as Git) should be installed on all the required devices. Second, it should be decided which type of Git workflow the team
should follow. There are multiple different kinds, including the Feature Branch Workflow, the Forking Workflow, and the Gitflow Workflow. When the most optimal workflow type has been
decided, the steps specific to that workflow should be taken.
