b. Explain how you can view changes made in a commit
To view changes in a Git commit, use the command line or a graphical tool.
On the command line, 'git show <commit>' displays the commit details and changes, while 'git diff <commit>^ <commit>' shows the diff between the commit and its parent.
For a summary of changes, use 'git log -p <commit>' or 'git diff --name-only <commit>^ <commit>'.
In graphical tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Git clients such as GitKraken, you can view commit details and diffs by navigating to the commit history and selecting the specific commit.
